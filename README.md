# GB Archive

This is an archive of GB stuff. It contains documentation, test roms, 
and more. Not everything here is guaranteed to be accurate as it's taken 
in its original form. Credit is given when the author of something is 
known.

Nothing here is created by me.

Most of this stuff is in here because it doesn't seem to have a 
healthy/maintainable mirror in case something happens to its source. I 
fear certain documentation going missing forever, so I created this to 
preserve it.

I try to keep everything here in its original form. I have tried to 
add info about inaccuracies in READMEs.

If you want to add something or correct some README info, please make a pull 
request. I don't want to add anything like dumped bootroms or leaked 
official documentation, so those will not be accepted.

If something of yours is here and you don't want it to be, let me know 
and I'll remove it.
